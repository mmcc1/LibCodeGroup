# LibCodeGroup
Cipher code Encoder/Decoder

LibCodeGroup converts a byte array to text for transmission.  Usually used for transmitting ciphertexts, it can be used anywhere text is preferrable to a byte array.

Also contains TTS to complete your numbers station vibe.  May only work in Windows though.
